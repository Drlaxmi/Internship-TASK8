# 🫀 Heart Failure Dashboard – Clinical Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard focused on **heart failure patient data**, designed using **Tableau** and exported as a presentation (`Heart failure.pptx`). The dashboard provides visual insights into patient demographics, clinical parameters, comorbidities, and outcomes to support research and clinical decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and visualize key clinical indicators associated with heart failure patients in order to:
- Identify high-risk groups based on age, gender, and ejection fraction
- Track relationships between comorbidities and mortality
- Provide an easy-to-understand summary for healthcare professionals and researchers

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### 1. **Demographic Breakdown**
- Age distribution of patients
- Gender ratio comparison

### 2. **Clinical Metrics**
- **Ejection Fraction (EF)** categories
- **Serum creatinine** and **sodium levels**
- Average **hospital stay duration**

### 3. **Comorbidities & Risk Factors**
- Hypertension
- Diabetes
- Smoking status
- Anemia

### 4. **Outcome Analysis**
- Death events grouped by clinical parameters
- Relationship between EF and mortality

### 5. **Interactive Filters**
- Filter data by gender, EF range, comorbid conditions, etc.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public/Desktop**: For dashboard development
- **MS PowerPoint**: For exporting and presenting the visualizations
- **Heart Failure Dataset**: (e.g., from Kaggle, UCI, or hospital records – as applicable)

## 📎 Files Included

| File Name          | Description                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Heart failure.pptx` | Exported dashboard presentation slides     |
| `Heart failure.twbx`| Tableau packaged workbook (optional)       |
| `README.md`         | Project documentation                     |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Patients with lower EF (<40%) show higher mortality risk
- Age and comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes influence outcomes
- Visual tools like Tableau can simplify clinical data interpretation

---

## 🔬 Future Enhancements
- Add time-series trends for readmissions or treatments
- Predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression on death event)
- Integration with real-time clinical databases
